# 🔧 Vercel Domain Configuration Guide

## Current Situation:
- ✅ You have 4 projects in Vercel
- ❌ Domain not configured properly for scoopunit.com

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Fix:

### **Step 1: Identify the Correct Project**

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**, look for these project names:
   - `scoopunit-website` 
   - `scoopunit`
   - Any project connected to `K1NGJ4W5/scoopunit-website` GitHub repo

2. **Click on the correct project** (should show recent deployments with Apple-inspired files)

### **Step 2: Configure Domain**

1. **In your Vercel project:**
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Domains" in left sidebar

2. **Add your domain:**
   - Type: `scoopunit.com`
   - Click "Add"

3. **Add www subdomain:**
   - Type: `www.scoopunit.com` 
   - Click "Add"

### **Step 3: DNS Configuration**

Vercel will show you exactly what DNS records to add. Typically:

**At your domain registrar (where you bought scoopunit.com):**

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### **Step 4: Set Primary Domain**

1. **In Domains section:**
   - Find `scoopunit.com` 
   - Click "..." menu → "Set as Primary"

2. **Configure redirect:**
   - Set `www.scoopunit.com` to redirect to `scoopunit.com`

### **Step 5: Force New Deployment**

1. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
2. **Click "Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. **Select "Use existing Build Cache"** → Click "Redeploy"

## 🚨 If You Have Multiple Projects:

**Delete unused projects:**
1. Go to each unused project
2. Settings → General → "Delete Project"
3. Keep only the one connected to your GitHub repo

## 🔍 How to Identify the Correct Project:

**Look for these indicators:**
- ✅ Connected to `K1NGJ4W5/scoopunit-website` GitHub repo
- ✅ Shows recent deployments (within last hour)
- ✅ File list shows `index.html`, `apple-inspired-styles.css`, etc.
- ✅ Latest commit: "Apple-inspired design transformation"

## 📋 Verification Checklist:

After configuration:
- [ ] Domain shows "scoopunit.com" in project settings
- [ ] DNS records are added at domain registrar  
- [ ] Latest deployment succeeded (green checkmark)
- [ ] Visit https://scoopunit.com shows Apple-inspired design

## ⚡ Quick Alternative:

**If domain configuration is complex, use the Vercel-provided URL:**
1. In your project dashboard, look for the deployment URL
2. It will be something like: `https://scoopunit-website-xyz.vercel.app`
3. This will show your Apple-inspired site immediately

## 🆘 Common Issues & Fixes:

### **Issue: "Domain already in use"**
