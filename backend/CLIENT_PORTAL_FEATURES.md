## üí° Proration Logic

### Service Upgrades (Additional Charges)
1. Calculate difference in monthly pricing
2. Determine days remaining in billing cycle
3. Apply proportional charge: `(priceDifference √ó daysRemaining) / totalDaysInCycle`
4. Charge immediately for current month additions
5. Update next billing cycle to new rate

### Service Downgrades (Credits)
1. Calculate monthly price reduction
2. Apply proportional credit for unused services
3. Credit applied to next billing cycle
4. No immediate refund for downgrades

### Payment Provider Switching
1. Update default payment method
2. Sync with appropriate provider (Stripe/QuickBooks)
3. Update subscription billing configuration
4. Maintain payment history across providers

### Cancellation Proration
1. Calculate services already provided
2. Determine remaining scheduled services
3. Calculate refund for unused portion
4. Apply any outstanding charges
5. Process final billing adjustment
