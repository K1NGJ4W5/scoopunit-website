## Troubleshooting

### If text appears too large:
1. Check if other CSS files are loaded after the mobile fixes
2. Ensure proper CSS specificity order
3. Clear browser cache

### If iOS still zooms on form inputs:
1. Verify all form inputs have `font-size: 16px !important`
2. Check for conflicting CSS rules
3. Test in actual iOS Safari, not desktop simulators

### If text shadows still appear problematic:
1. Ensure mobile-typography-fixes.css loads last
2. Check for CSS specificity conflicts
3. Use browser dev tools to verify shadow removal

## Maintenance
- Update version number in CSS link when making changes
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Monitor Core Web Vitals for performance impact
- Consider user feedback on readability

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated files to production
2. Test on multiple mobile devices
3. Monitor user behavior analytics for improvements
4. Consider A/B testing for optimal font sizes
