# üîê SSL Certificate Fix for scoopunit.com

## Current Issue:
- ‚úÖ Website loads correctly at https://scoopunit.com
- ‚ùå Browser shows "Not Secure" warning
- ‚ùå SSL certificate mismatch (*.github.io vs scoopunit.com)

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: GitHub Pages SSL Fix
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/K1NGJ4W5/scoopunit-website/settings/pages
2. **Under "Custom domain":** 
   - Remove `scoopunit.com` (leave blank)
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait 2 minutes
3. **Re-add custom domain:**
   - Type `scoopunit.com` back in
   - Click "Save" 
   - GitHub will re-provision SSL certificate

### Step 2: Enable HTTPS Enforcement
1. **After 15-30 minutes:**
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS" option should be available
   - Check the box
   - Click "Save"

### Step 3: DNS Verification (if needed)
Ensure your DNS records are correct:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: scoopunit.com  
Value: k1ngj4w5.github.io

OR

Type: A
Name: scoopunit.com
Values: 
  185.199.108.153
  185.199.109.153  
  185.199.110.153
  185.199.111.153
```

## Expected Timeline:
- **Immediate:** Website continues to work (may show warning)
- **15-30 minutes:** SSL certificate provisions
- **30-60 minutes:** "Enforce HTTPS" becomes available
- **Full resolution:** 1-24 hours for global SSL propagation

## How to Test:
1. **Visit:** https://scoopunit.com
2. **Look for green lock** in browser address bar
3. **Check certificate:** Click lock icon ‚Üí Certificate details
4. **Should show:** Issued to scoopunit.com (not *.github.io)

## Temporary Workaround:
If SSL is taking too long, users can visit:
- **http://scoopunit.com** (without https)
- **https://k1ngj4w5.github.io/scoopunit-website/** (GitHub direct URL)

Both will show your Apple-inspired design correctly.

## Why This Happened:
- GitHub Pages needs time to provision SSL for custom domains
- Certificate mismatch occurs during the provisioning period
- This is normal and resolves automatically within 24 hours
