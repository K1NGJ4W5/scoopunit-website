# ðŸš€ Enable GitHub Pages - Step by Step

Since I cannot access web interfaces directly, here are the EXACT steps:

## Option 1: Manual GitHub Pages Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Open this URL in your browser:**
   ```
   https://github.com/K1NGJ4W5/scoopunit-website/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Source" section:**
   - Click the dropdown that says "None"
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"

3. **Under "Branch" section:**
   - Select "master" from the dropdown
   - Leave "/ (root)" selected
   - Click "Save"

4. **Result:**
   - GitHub will show: "Your site is live at https://scoopunit.com"
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

## Option 2: Run Auto-Deploy Script

**Double-click:** `auto-deploy.bat` in your scoopunit-website folder

This will:
